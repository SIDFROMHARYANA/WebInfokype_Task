        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by computers, as opposed to human or animal intelligence. "Intelligence" encompasses the ability to learn and to reason, to generalize, and to infer meaning.
        AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
