        Electronic devices are components for controlling the flow of electrical currents for the purpose of information processing and system control. 
        Prominent examples include transistors and diodes. Electronic devices are usually small and can be grouped together into packages called integrated circuits. This miniaturization is central to the modern electronics boom.
